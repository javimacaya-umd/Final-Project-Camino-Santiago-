    "Town":"Irún",
    "Image":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheasant_Island#/media/File:Isla_de_los_Faisanes-edited.jpg",
    "Description1":"The industrial and commercial character of Irún make it the most significant city on the banks of the Bidasoa river.",
    "Description2":"A mere three kilometres separate Irún from Hondarribia. Both of them face the French city of Hendaia, with the Bidasoa river as their boundary. Irún has the appearance of a new city, although it is possible to find in it important vestiges from the past. One of them is the church of Santa María del Juncal, from the 16th century, with a Baroque façade, and a Romanesque image of the saint.",
    "Description3":"Another monumental building is the Baroque City Hall, across from the column of Saint John of Harri, which commemorates the city's independence. Near the square of Urdanibia we find the hermitage of Santa Elena, built on top of a Roman necropolis and temple. We can also visit the Museum of the hermitage of Ama Xantalen.",
    "Description4":"The local and regional calendar of leisure, cultural and sporting activities is very diverse, with choices that go from golf, horseback riding, hang gliding, and canoeing, to the many national and international festivals, which include film, theatre, video art by young filmmakers, and so on. As in Hondarribia, in Irún they also celebrate the \"Alarde de Armas\" (Weapons Display), a reminiscence of the law-enforcing militias that each town organised and trained.",
    "Description5":"From the border posts that are close to the city, we can continue our Basque Coast excursion through the french towns of Sokoa, San Juan de Luz, Biarritz and Baiona, places of great interest and easy to access."

    "Description1":"This city, also known as Donostia, lies along a white sandy bay between the Urgull and Igeldo hills.",
    "Description2":"Fishermen's houses, a smart suburb and modern districts make it one of the most attractive cities on the Cantabrian coast. The Museum of San Telmo, the Peine del Viento (the Wind Comb) and the Kursaal are examples of how the city brings together modern and traditional features.",
    "Description3":"Meanwhile, the province of Guipuzcoa, of which San Sebastián is the capital, blends sea and mountains, offering the traveller landscape, sports and cuisine, as well as interesting monuments. Basque cuisine has a recognised international prestige.",
    "Description4":"The town centre streets of San Sebastián unfold overlooking the La Concha Bay. Monte Igeldo marks one end of it - a wonderful vantage point for enjoying views over the city. At its feet is Torrepea Point, where the “Peine de los Vientos” (\"the Wind Comb\"), a sculpture by the famous Basque artist Eduardo Chillida, is installed. Here Ondarreta beach begins, framed by a garden area and by the Pico del Loro. This was the place chosen by Queen Maria Cristina (18th C.) to build the Miramar Palace, her summer residence. A lovely promenade with elegant railings and street lamps runs along La Concha Beach, on whose sands is the Perla del Océano Bathing Area, a former royal bathing hut.",
    "Description5":"Still looking at the sea, you arrive at the old Casino, nowadays the City Hall. In this area, between the sea and the River Urumea, is the old town and the way to Monte Urgull, the marina and the fishermen's district. The summit of Urgull is dominated by La Mota Castle and a representation of the Sacred Heart. One path takes you upwards while another skirts the hill and takes you along the breakwater."

    "Description2":"This ancient settlement of whale hunters became an important tourist village in the 19th century. Its elegant beach, the longest in the province, has a quiet promenade on the shore of the Cantabrian Sea, decorated with numerous vanguard sculptures. Zarautz's waves make it a paradise for surf lovers. The city centre has some features that will surprise the visitor, such as the Gothic tower of Luzea, the medieval church of Santa María la Real, and the Renaissance palace of Narros. This city has numerous ancestral homes, and Portu Palace from the 16th century, on the shore of the Cantabrian Sea. Other cultural activities available include a visit to the Basque Museum of Photography, and to the Zarautz Museum of Art and History. Any journey through the city should include trying some of the local cuisine, and nothing better than \"pintxos\" (canapés), and fresh fish casseroles, which go excellently with some wine from the Designation of Origin-Chacolí de Guetaria-Guetariako-Txakolina.",

    "Description2":"We will discover one of the most spectacular stretches of the Basque coastdue to the sea erosion. Next to steep cliffs we will notice a plain surface, very peculiar from a geological point of view, that reveals itself when low tide and shelters many migratory birds. Located in the centre of the Basque coast, Deba offers the visitor the stillness of Mendata, Aitzuri and Sakoneta coves and beautiful beaches: Santiago and Lapari. We find different promenades next to them: paseo de Sorozabal, Paseo de Cárdenas and Paseo de Arrantzales that lead us, along the river, to the nautical port.",
    "Description3":"Moreover, the interior of Deba shows its most hidden spots: valleys of intense green colour with country houses ideal for trips on foot, by bike and horse. Besides, more than fifty caves and prehistoric sites stretch down the area. In some of those caves, in Ekain, to be precise, cave paintings and generous material very necessary to study in depth Basque prehistory have been found. Likewise, Deba has an important architectural heritage. In the heart of the historical part of the town we will find the church of Santa María de Deba, considered a national monument and a jewel of Basque Gothic architecture. The village's main festival is consecrated to its patron Saint, San Roque. The festival takes place on August 14th-20th and the visitor will enjoy different activities such as the tamborrada or drum parade, bull-runnings and night-concerts.",

    "Description2":"Since Zenarruza und La Puebla de Bolibar separated from the municipality in 2005, the town, founded about the middle of the 14th century, consists of two villages: Markina and Xemein. The village's centre still maintains its medieval layout and offers a vast heritage display. We can visit the church of El Carmen, whose façade shows a sculpture of the virgin and the coat of arms of the Carmelite Order. The palaces Solartekua (present Town Hall), Andonegi and Ansotegi, Antxia tower and the former Town Hall are, among others, some of the interesting buildings in town. In the surroundings of Markina-Xemein we will find also some places to visit. For example the beautiful Patrokua palace, the church of Santa María de la Asunción de Xemein, declared Euskadi National Monument, or the chapel of San Miguel de Arretxinaga, hexagonal temple, whose altar is formed by three big rocks. Cradle of great pelotaris Markina-Xemein keeps a tight connection with Basque pelota sport; in fact its two walled court or frontón is known as \"University of the Pelota\", since it is the place where great Basket or Jai Alai pelotaris learnt to play. The town holds festivities in honour of its patron saint, Carmen, in mid-July. The municipality also hosts numerous fairs and markets during the year, highlights among which include the farmers' fair in October, and Carnival is a good time to visit this town and discover its culture and customs.",

    "Description2":"The cave of Santimamiñe (Kortezubi) shows that the valley has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Inside are cave paintings comparable in terms of quality and richness to those of Altamira. From that period on, Gernika was inhabited by successive civilizations until its foundation as a town in 1366.",
    "Description3":"In town, you must visit the Casa de Juntas del Señorío de Vizcaya (the meeting hall of the gentlemen of VIzcaya), with its symbolic tree - the Basque leaders used to meet under it to decide on the interests of the community-, the “juradera” church of Santa María, the Museum of Euskalerria and the Parque de la Paz (park of peace), with colossal sculptures by Eduardo Chillida and Henry Moore.",
    "Description4":"In 1937, during the Civil War, the town was totally destroyed by German aircraft sent by Hitler. This experimental act, which inspired Picasso's legendary painting, was the first of similar atrocities carried out in subsequent wars. En 1987, the 50th anniversary of the bombing was held along with the Preliminary Congress of the World Association of Martyred Cities. Gernika has earned the title of “peace symbol city', twinning with other cities and making commitments to cooperating with them in the fields of culture, education, and industry: Berga (Catalonia), Pforzheim (Germany) and Boise (Idaho - USA).",

    "Description3":"Near the church we'll notice Lezama tower, built in the 14th century. Moreover, because of the village's location on the foothill of Ganguren range, we will be able to enjoy one of the best views in Bizkaia.",
    "Description4":"Likewise Lezama has a horse-riding club, an excellent place to practice horse riding in a magnificent natural landscape. Lezama's main festival takes place on September 8, a good day to visit the village and enjoy its festive atmosphere.",

    "Description1":"“The city of the Guggenheim” is an alternative name for this Basque Country destination as, since this original museum was built in 1997, Bilbao has been transformed forever. In fact, now it stands out for its ground-breaking structures created by prestigious architects, and which make it an international benchmark for modern design.",
    "Description2":"Although, curiously, its unique character comes from combining avant-garde with the traditional feel of its old town, full of charming streets and bars offering pintxos, proof that they are passionate about gastronomy around here. All this has earned Bilbao a place of honour on the lists of Spain’s most interesting cities.",
    "Description3":"A visit to this city in the north of Spain could start with the Guggenheim Museum. It is one of the most surprising examples of 20th century architecture as Frank Gehry used 33,000 ultra-thin titanium plates to create its curious curves. Inside, it shares the world’s most important private collection of modern and contemporary art with New York and Venice. Bilbao is home to another of Spain’s most important art museums: the Museum of Fine Arts.",
    "Description4":"The city of Bilbao is proof that gastronomy is an art in the Basque Country – one of the areas with the most Michelin Stars per person in the world. Plaza Nueva and its surrounding streets are full of busy bars serving their famous pintxos: small, delicious bites of food. Here, foodies can find their place among the buzzing bars, family-run restaurants and prestigious chefs. And they will also have the chance to visit the La Ribera Market, a beautiful building where you can have the produce that you purchase cooked for you, or where you can sample as selection of pintxos and Txakoli wine to the beat of live music.",
    "Description5":"Cultural and culinary Bilbao is also a green city, with parks such as Doña Casilda de Iturrizar, surrounded by hills (dare to ride the Artxanda cable car, a classic option to get a bird’s eye view of Bilbao). The estuary is another symbol of the regeneration of Bilbao. You can spot people paddle surfing on the water, or take a boat to the famous Hanging Bridge of Portugalete, declared a World Heritage Site."

    "Description2":"The town centre, with its characteristic houses with wooden rows of balconies, is medieval in origin and earned recognition as a Historic Site in 1978. Its main monuments, of different styles and periods, contrast with the seafaring sobriety of the old village, formed by narrow streets which are perfect for strolling through. The buildings of the church of Santa María, from the 13th to the 15th centuries, the most significant example of Cantabria's Gothic architecture, and the castle-lighthouse, visible from all parts of town, are the most representative sights in Castro Urdiales.",
    "Description3":"The town also possesses highly valuable examples of cave painting, such as in the cave of Peña del Cuco, which contains drawings from the Upper Paleolithic period, with reproductions of deer, horses and goats. Equally worth a mention is the Roman archaeological site of Flavióbriga, which occupies the entire subsoil of the current city, at a depth of around two metres.",

    "Description3":"The town is structured into three very different zones: the old village and its neighbourhood, the area of the newer suburbs and the extension of this towards El Puntal.",
    "Description4":"The first of these was declared to be a Historic-Artistic Site in 1970. It is the original population centre, dating from the Middle Ages, and it still preserves remains of its old walls. It consists of a network of small streets, on which large stately houses from the 16th to the 18th centuries stand, like those of the Mar family, of the Marchioness of Arcentales, of the High Constable, or of the Hoz and Gutiérrez Rada families. In the highest part of this sector is the parish church of Santa María de la Asunción, with a Gothic layout and which houses a magnificent Flemish reredos inside. The second area, the newer part, which stretches until Plaza de Carlos V, is today the commercial, administrative and service centre. Lastly, between Plaza de Carlos V and El Puntal, you will find three large avenues which run parallel to one another, flanked by the town's two beaches.",
    "Description5":"Outstanding among Laredo's festivals is the Flower Battle, which is held on the last Friday in August and is a wonderful display of light and colour."

Many cities within a city, perfect for discovering.",
    "Description3":"Santander was the destination par excellence for royalty at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. A stroll through the old quarters, with its majestic buildings, transports us to this distinguished past, the greatest witness of which is undoubtedly the Magdalena Palace, the jewel in the city’s crown. This iconic building, located in the highest part of the peninsula of the same name, is one of the essential sights of Santander, allowing you to observe (and photograph) an impressive panoramic view of “the bride of the sea”, as the city is affectionately known, framed by the beach and mountains.",
    "Description4":"Santander fuses this palatial magic with a fishing tradition, which today can be enjoyed especially in the area known as the city’s fishing district: the perfect place to try the most traditional local cuisine, so closely linked to the sea, with dishes such as rabas (fried squid), maganos (squid with onion) or fisherman-style clams.",
    "Description5":"This identity of contrasts is completed with the “new” Santander, the part that has embraced the latest cultural and artistic trends, which is evident in places such as the Botín Centre, designed by the architect and Pritzker Architecture prize winner, Renzo Piano."

    "Description4":"The centre of this village, declared a National Monument, continues to contain the collegiate church, considered one of the best examples of Romanesque architecture in Cantabria. Built on the site of a former hermitage in the XII century, you can admire its cloister with magnificent decorated capitals, as well as its interesting façade decorated with sculptures and Panthocrator (a representation of Christ framed in an almond shaped structure).",

    "Description3":"Llanes also has magnificent beaches, such as San Antolín, Torimbia, Barro, Celorio, Poo, Sablón, and Toró. If you like natural areas, you can stroll along Paseo de San Pedro, a clifftop walk more than a kilometre long, with great views over the town and the Cantabrian Sea.",

    "Description1":"The distinctive feature of the urban layout of Ribadesella is the bridge that divides the fishing port in two, and which every first Saturday in August is the finishing line in most Asturias' most emblematic festival: the canoe descent of the Sella River. Its historic quarter has been declared Property of Cultural Interest.",
    "Description2":"The historic town of Ribadesella was founded by King Alfonso X the Wise in the 13th century. It offers visitors an interesting mix of mediaeval town and Modernist architecture in addition to an outstanding beach area. The town has two clearly distinct parts: the east side with the old part of the city, and the west side, home of the Tito Bustillo cave, one of the treasures of European cave art.",
    "Description3":"Similar to the one in Altamira, the cave contains impressive stalactites and paintings. In summer, it's a good idea to get there early if you want to be assured admission. It also has a museum containing the prehistoric findings in the area.",
    "Description4":"Highlights of the historic quarter include the churches of Santa Maria de Junco and San Esteban de Leces –Romanesque in origin–, the Gothic chapel of Santa Ana (15th century) and the Renaissance chapel of Nuestra Señora de Guía (16th century). The Town Hall in the Renaissance and Plateresque style is an outstanding example of civil architecture, as are the numerous stately homes dating from the 17th and 18th centuries.",
    "Description5":"A considerable number of romantic villas in the Modernist and eclectic style sprang up in the modern district of Arenal de Santa Marina between the end of the 19th and the start of the 20th centuries, including the Modernist Villa Rosario, built by members of the rich bourgeoisie who had made their fortunes in the Americas. "

Its marina is a testament to its close links with the sea throughout its history. It was shortlisted in the European Commission's EDEN programme (European Destinations of Excellence), in recognition of its sustainable tourism proposal.",
    "Description2":"Its various major constructions date from the city's past as a Roman settlement, from its development in the 16th century when the Catholic monarchs decided to install a port here, and from the boom enjoyed by the area at the time of the Enlightenment, primarily thanks to Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos.",
    "Description3":"The historic quarter of Gijón is formed by the hill of Santa Catalina and the fishing neighbourhood of Cimadevilla. The first settlers established communities on top of this hill and it has been chosen as the site for the “Elogio del Horizonte” (Eulogy of the Horizon), a monumental work by the Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida. This point provides some of the best views of the Cantabrian Sea, the Costa Verde and Cimadevilla. The streets between the beach of San Lorenzo and the marina gather together Roman remains, large mansions and the old houses of the fishermen.",
    "Description4":"In Plaza Mayor we can see the City Hall building (19th century), while in Jovellanos square you will find the Museum of Gijón and the birthplace of Jovellanos, an enlightened politician and writer who was born in this city. This building, from the 16th century, contains mementos and paintings and sculpture by several artists. Attached to the building is the chapel of Los Remedios, where you will find his tomb.",
    "Description5":"Awaiting us in the modern city is a rationalist layout with a great many squares and green areas such as the Gardens of Náutico, Begoña or Reina. It is worth taking a look at the shops in Calle Corrida, the old cafés and cider bars of Paseo Begoña or taking Calle Uría y Menéndez Valdés to the Jovellanos Theatre."

    "Description2":"Avilés is the third major city in the Principality of Asturias. Its historic quarter has been declared a Historic-Artistic Site, since it houses significant gems of civil and religious architecture. Some of the main attractions are the pedestrian streets of Galiana and Rivero, Plaza de España with its City Hall, the old church of Sabugo, from the 13th century, and the modern Santo Tomás de Canterbury. In terms of civil architecture, Avilés can boast the palaces of Valdecarzana and Camposagrado and the Palacio Valdés theatre.",
    "Description3":"In 1980 came the opening of the new fishing dock and fishermen's guild of Virgen de las Mareas, whose market auctions almost 70% of the fish caught in Asturias, which has placed Avilés, despite a limited fishing fleet, at the head of the ports in Asturias in this sector.",

In September 1934, prior to the outbreak of Spanish civil war, the ship Vapor Turquesa landed a large cargo of weapons that were supposed to be sent to Ethiopia. These weapons remaining permanently in Asturias caused numerous problems during the Civil War.",
    "Description3":"In Muros de Nalón, the Civil War broke a day later than other areas of Asturias. After the Spanish Civil War and the creation of Ensidesa in Avilés, the municipality experienced a great industrial development until the 1970s, when the crisis affected the Spanish industry.",

A small river divides the town in two, although several narrow bridges are there to unite it. Its most characteristic buildings are the lighthouse, the chapel of Atalaya and the cemetery overlooking the sea, cut from the rock by pickaxe and the final resting place of the remains of the Nobel laureate Severo Ochoa, a native of this town.

On this deep estuary, formed by the river Eo, the main town is Ribadeo. The town's stately appearance can be seen from the nearby summit of mount Santa Cruz, where a popular pilgrimage is held every first Sunday in August and which has been declared to be of tourist interest because it is a celebration of traditional local cuisine and music.",
    "Description2":"The Marquis of Sargadelos was the modern promoter of this city whose most outstanding building is the modernist Galician country house of the Moreno brothers. From the port of Porcillán, which is of Roman origin, it is a pleasant walk to the lighthouse of Pancha island, situated on the mouth of the estuary, passing the ruins of the castle of San Damián. On your return, there is nothing more gratifying than to delight at the seafood taken straight from the estuary, such as cockles, clams and oysters, which, along with salmon, trout and eels from the Eo, are the star ingredients of the local cuisine. Not forgetting the delicious sweets made by the nuns at the convent of Santa Clara.",
    "Description3":"It is also a good idea to spare some time for As Catedrais, one of the most beautiful stretches of sand on the Galician coastline. Its rocks, which form natural arches resembling a cathedral, create a magical landscape which changes with the tides, the high point of a walk facing the open sea.",

    "Description1":"For centuries, thousands of pilgrims have travelled on St. James’ Way every year, finally reaching the capital of Galicia and entering the iconic Cathedral. According to tradition, this is the burial place of the relics of James the Apostle, discovered in the 9th century.",
    "Description2":"But Santiago de Compostela is very much a living city, with other attractions for travellers, pilgrim or not: countless restaurants and bars where you can enjoy the delicious seafood of Galicia, a UNESCO World Heritage old town centre, daring contemporary art… There's plenty to do in this city which combines history with a younger modern side.",
    "Description3":"Perhaps the most special place in Santiago is Plaza del Obradoiro. Life in the city seems to revolve around this point, the site of the Cathedral, Raxoi Palace, and the luxurious Hostal de los Reyes Católicos, said to be the world’s oldest hotel. On this square you’re likely to see pilgrims with their inevitable walking sticks and scallop shells. There is a ritual for visiting the Cathedral for the first time: admire the Portico de la Gloria, embrace the figure of St. James on the main altar, go down to the crypt, go up to the rooftop (what a view!) and if you’re lucky, see the botafumeiro (an enormous censer) in action—they only use it on religious holidays or if requested in advance.",
    "Description4":"Around the Cathedral, every step is a discovery, with other very charming squaressuch as Praterías (with the best view of the belltower, La Berenguela) or Quintana with its pretty stairs and other monuments like the imposing Monastery of San Martiño Pinario.",
    "Description5":"It’s curious that even the far outskirts of the city seem as if they were designed for admiring the Cathedral. An example is the quiet Alameda Park and the viewing point of Monte do Gozo, with sculptures of pilgrims which have starred in so many photographs."
