    "Description1":"Santiago de Compostela is very much a living city, with many attractions for travellers, pilgrim or not: countless restaurants and bars where you can enjoy the delicious seafood of Galicia, a UNESCO World Heritage old town centre and daring contemporary art. There's plenty to do in this city which combines history with a younger modern side.",
    "Description2":"Perhaps the most special place in Santiago is Plaza del Obradoiro. Life in the city seems to revolve around this point, the site of the Cathedral, Raxoi Palace, and the luxurious Hostal de los Reyes Católicos, said to be the world's oldest hotel. On this square you are likely to see pilgrims with their inevitable walking sticks and scallop shells. There is a ritual for visiting the Cathedral for the first time: admire the Portico de la Gloria, embrace the figure of St. James on the main altar, go down to the crypt, go up to the rooftop (what a view!) and if you are lucky, see the botafumeiro (an enormous censer) in action‚ they only use it on religious holidays or if requested in advance."
